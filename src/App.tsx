            I want to start by saying I am truly sorry for all the mistakes I have made.
            For the times I hurt you, disappointed you, or failed to understand you
            the way you deserved which I take full responsibility. You never deserved
            anything less than my best.
          </p>

          <p>
            I know that words alone are not enough, but I promise you that I am
            learning, growing, and becoming better. I will change not just because
            I’m afraid of losing you, but because you inspire me to become a better
            man, more patient, more understanding, and more loving every day.
          </p>

          <p>
            You are one of the greatest blessings in my life. Your presence brings
            light into my darkest days, and your love gives me strength I never
            knew I had. I appreciate you more than I can ever fully express
            your kindness, your support, your beautiful heart.
          </p>

          <p>
            Thank you for staying, for loving me, and for believing in us.
            I will keep proving to you that your love is safe with me.
          </p>

          <p className="font-semibold text-rose-600">
            With all my love, you will always be my sweet baby
